      <description>As a Product Manager, more often than not, I notice people mixing up &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;execution&lt;/em&gt; in discussions. Both these concepts have entirely unique levels of fidelity to what the finished product will be. It’s important for Product Managers to know the difference between these two concepts, how to manage them, and what importance they should have at different stages of the product development cycle. Not understanding the differences between an &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; and an &lt;em&gt;execution&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t just a minor inconvenience; it&amp;rsquo;s a significant obstacle to innovation and strategic execution for products and companies.</description>

      <description>Blitzscaling is a term coined by entrepreneur and investor Reid Hoffman, which refers to a strategy for rapidly scaling up a company in a short period. The idea behind blitzscaling is to prioritize growth over profitability, aiming to dominate a market and become a category leader. While blitzscaling can lead to significant success for companies, it also has some significant downsides.</description>

      <description>Most people consider strategy to be an event, some magical moment that changes the course of a company and defines its success for generations. The tale goes, some smart people get together (or occasionally one solo genius), they decide what they are going to do, and then they start implementing that strategy. That&amp;rsquo;s actually not the way the world works.</description>

      <description>On the 7th of September, Apple held its “Far Out” iPhone event. New iPhones, Apple Watches, and AirPods were announced, each coming with a plethora of features. Yes, all of it was innovation, but none of it brought the kind of excitement Apple used to. Why is that? And why probably this is the best strategy for Apple.</description>
